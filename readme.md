## Responsive Design Notes

- **Mobile:** Layout adjusts to fit smaller screens with a single-column structure and touch-friendly buttons.  
- **Tablet/Desktop:** Elements are arranged for balanced visibility and interaction.  
- **Landscape Mode:** A specialized layout that reduces vertical spacing, aligns buttons and text side-by-side, and ensures comfort on wider but shorter screens.
