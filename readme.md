# 🔐 Password Generator

## Overview

I built this project as a modern, responsive password generator using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The goal was to create a simple but powerful tool that helps users generate secure passwords with flexible options and a clean, engaging interface.  

It’s fully bilingual (**English/Spanish**) and adapts smoothly to different devices and orientations — including a dedicated **landscape mode** for tablets and phones.

## Features

- **Flexible Password Length**  
  Generate passwords anywhere between 4 and 32 characters.

- **Character Options**  
  Mix and match uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

- **Multilingual Support**  
  Switch instantly between English and Spanish.

- **Real-time Feedback**  
  See the character count update live and get a dynamic strength indicator.

- **One-click Copy**  
  Copy your password straight to the clipboard with a confirmation message.

- **Strength Indicator**  
  Color-coded feedback shows how strong your password is.

- **Animated Link Hover**  
  My developer link includes a neat hover animation — an icon slides in smoothly instead of the usual underline.

- **Responsive Design (Landscape Ready)**  
  Special media query for landscape mode: optimized spacing, font sizes, and alignment for wider but shorter screens.

## Responsive Design Notes

- **Mobile:** Single-column layout with touch-friendly buttons.  
- **Tablet/Desktop:** Balanced layout for visibility and usability.  
- **Landscape Mode:** Reduced vertical spacing, side-by-side alignment, and optimized readability for horizontal screens.
